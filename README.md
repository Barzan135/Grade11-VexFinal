# Grade11-VexFinal

After awhile of bug fixing, this is a complete version of
code I used during my time programming Vex V5, 
although not the best it did work and worked
quite well. Feel free to use this code in whatever
way you'd like. 

As for some improvements use Vex systems (either 3-pin or new) such as gyro's, distance sensors,
etc. Documentation found: https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/tutorials/topical/adi.html

This is using PROS instead of the actual VEX V5 editor, so certain features
might not work as expected unless using PROS.
